These codes were used in the article of "Topographical and Laminar Distribution of Audiovisual Processing within Human Planum Temporale". 

spm_feat.sh is used to split original time series into control and dante-prepared, generate mask for motion correction, compute motion cencor, generate the time series of VAPER contrast and perform regressional analysis.

mc_run.m motion correction

colomnProfile.sh/m extracts columnar profile, layerProfile extracts laminar profile

layerSmooth.sh generates cortical layers and does laminar smoothing

correctRate.m computes the response time and detection accuracy of vigilance task
